# Elections_Data_76_2020
Using PostgreSQL I analyze Presidential Elections Data from 1976 to 2020. The ultimate goal is to find the winner per election year with the total vote, and the vote per states. The SQL codes and images will show the outcome of this analysis.

##Results

### 1) To get the candidate name and year in which they run for election
